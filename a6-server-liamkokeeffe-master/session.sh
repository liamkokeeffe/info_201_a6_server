# document here the main bash commands you are using for the server access.  The file contains
# two parts: the first one for the commands you run on your laptop, and the second one for the
# commands on the remote server.
# 
# The question lists give your some guidance what to do and report but you are free to do it
# in a different way.  If you use a graphical frontend instead of scp for copying files,
# just say which one in the appropriate place.
#
# Note: this file does not to be runnable
#
# -------------------- local commands --------------------
# 1. create a directory for this project.

# 2. log onto the server

# 3. copy the small data subset from the server to your local machine

# 4. copy your R-script to the server

# 5. (after succesfully running the script remotely): copy the output files back to your computer

# 6. inspect that the copy was successful


# -------------------- remote commands --------------------
# 1. explore the data directory '/opt/data'.  How do you find out the size of the files?

# 2. explore the first few lines of the small sample data

# 3. create a directory for this project

# 4. (after copying your code from the laptop): inspect the files in the project directory

# 5. run your script

# 6. How do you install missing R packages?

# 7. (after running the script): inspect the folder for output files
